<h2>SmartPhone</h2>
<p>A smartphone is a mobile device that combines cellular and mobile computing functions into one unit.
They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems,
which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing[1] over mobile broadband),
and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.
Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer), and support wireless communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).</p>
