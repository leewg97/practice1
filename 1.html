<h2>IPhone</h2>
<p>The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen.
  It connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi, and can make calls,
  browse the web, take pictures, play music and send and receive emails
  and text messages. Since the iPhone's launch further features have been added,
  including larger screen sizes, shooting video, waterproofing,
  the ability to install third-party mobile apps through an app store,
  and many accessibility features. Up to 2017, iPhones used a layout with a single button
  on the front panel that returns the user to the home screen. Since 2017, more expensive
  iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with app switching
  activated by gesture recognition.</p>
